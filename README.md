## knapsack with genetics algorithms
genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem. Given size of a knapsack, a number of items, weight & benefit of each item. You should select the
maximum number of items that could fit in the knapsack and at the same time provide/ensure the maximum benefit.

## Smooth Curve Fitting
Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function (e.g. polynomial equation) that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. In smooth curve fitting, function is constructed to approximately fit the data.
In this assignment, we are given set of points and would like to fit a curve using a polynomial equation to them. Using genetic algorithms, find the best coefficients that would make the distance between the polynomial and the points minimum.

## Fuzzy set
In this program a fuzzy toolbox created,The toolbox support the following functionally:	
1)	fuzzy set (membership function). (Fuzzy sets could be trapezoidal or triangular)
2)	linguistic variable,a membership functions to each linguistic term.
3)	Fuzzify a crisp input (E.g. the crisp input of “Rate”=10).
4)	Process given rules and combine their outputs. A rule may contain up to 10 fuzzy premises and one consequent. (After taking the rules from the user and fuzzifying the crisp inputs you should be able to process.
5)	Defuzzify the output similar to what you took in the lecture




## Back propagation Neural Networks
this consists of two programs. The first one implements the back propagation algorithm and the second one implements the feed forward. In both program, you will need to read the input (x vector) and the output (y vector) from a file. Below is the structure of the input file:
1) First line: M, L, N where M is number of Input Nodes, L is number of Hidden Nodes and N is number of Output Nodes
2) Second line: K, the number of training examples, each line has length M+N values, first M values are X vector and last N values are output values. 3) K lines follow as described
